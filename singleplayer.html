It has spawned a large community of gamers, content providers, and modders, and has become a cultural phenomenon. Minecraft has also been utilized as an instructional tool as well as a platform for a variety of events such as concerts and festivals. MInecraft has been a staple in my childhood. <br> <br>This game introduced me to the broad range of different video games from Club Penguin to Call of Duty. The minecraft model on the left is one of the first custom models I used when playing minecraft. The skin is based on a character called Jango Fett from Star Wars. This game created so many fond memories with friends and family.
